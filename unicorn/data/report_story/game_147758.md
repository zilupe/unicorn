Yet another exciting encounter between long-time arch-rivals [F:10] and [F:14] was decided in the last
two minutes of the game.

With less than a minute on game clock and [T:0105.4896] leading by 5 points,
[T:0105.5078]'s Francesco goes to free throw line, makes the first, misses the second, but somehow 
manages to get a far rebound beyond the arc and immediately makes a three pointer. A couple of turnovers
go both ways until [T:0105.4896] at +1 have little idea about how much time they have and attempt a shot
with 7 seconds to go. The shot is short, rebound is wild and Francesco chases it and goes on a fast break
and makes a layup. [T:0105.4896] are shocked and fail to call timeout with around 2 seconds remaining
on clock. The time runs out and [T:0105.5078] win by a point: 34-33.

[T:0105.4896] were without Eddie and Scott while [T:0105.5078] lost Claudio early in the game due 
to an injury. Sophie who plays for both teams this season, played for [T:0105.5078].
