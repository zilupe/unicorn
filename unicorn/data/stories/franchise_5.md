The early record of this franchise is still not confirmed.

This site recognises the [F:5] franchise as the one behind the team in which the three Davids have played
most of the time.

We believe these are [T:0062.4232], [T:0070.5015], [T:0073.5015], [T:0079.5015], [T:0086.5015], [T:0096.5015], [T:0098.5015],
[T:0100.5015], [T:0101.5015], [T:0102.5015], [T:0104.5015], however, we have not ruled out the possibility that the
records we have for [T:0070.5078], [T:0073.5015], [T:0079.5015] might belong to the no longer existing franchise
[F:12]; which means that [F:5] actually should include records from [T:0070.5078], [T:0073.5078], and [T:0079.5078] 
instead.
