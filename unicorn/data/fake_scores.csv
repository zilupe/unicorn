79982,42,29,3,"Correct winner (E=MC SWISH). E=MC SWISH second title out of three consecutive ones."
113863,31,36,2,"Correct winner (Rockets) and probably the score too. Found on WhatsApp team chat, written by Eddie: 'After half it was 4:22 (yes 4) but at the end 31:36. Or close to that. We definitely lost by 5pts.'"
